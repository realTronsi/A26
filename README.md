Tronsi: see compiler.c I left a msg for you -_-

**A statically typed esoteric language written in C**

The language consists of 26 registers, each labeled from **A-Z**, and a global register **@**.

#

## Documentation

Registers can be declared using their respective symbol followed a a pair of braces.

### Global Register

Represented by @ symbol

The global register is where the program begins to run, so you must include it within your program. 

```js
@ {

}
```
